<p> 
    I was born and raised in a little town called Sutter that is right outside of Yuba City, CA. I now reside in Elk Grove, CA and have been living there for about a year. I have an almost 2 year old daughter with my fiance and am also getting married in June 2020.
    <br>
    I am new to coding and am excited to learn the ins and outs of it all. I always love a challenge and this course has proven to live up to that. When I put my mind to something there is no changing that until I master whatever it is that I am working on.
