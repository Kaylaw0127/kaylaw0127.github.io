# Description 
This portfolio was created to display the projects that I will be completing during this bootcamp. I have done this to show future employers my best worst, to give them a better understanding of what I can do.

A main part of this project that I stuggled with were getting the padding and margins to line up correctly in CSS. 

# Features
[About] The main content about myself to let employers learn about me.

[Portfolio] The projects that I will be completing throughout the bootcamp.

[Contact] A way to let others contact me.
